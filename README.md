Introduction

You’re staring at a whole classroom full of students. As you explain the project you’re about to give them, you notice that some of them look at you with bright eyes, excited to learn. While that fills you with joy, your eyes continue to scan and you begin to see the whole range of expressions. One student is looks bored out of his mind as he starts to fall asleep in your class. Another rolls their eyes at every word you say. As you explain how important this project is, you notice that some students begin to look really nervous while others are getting pumped. You begin to wonder, 

“I wonder what motivates these students to act like this?” 

In the game, “Guess that Motivation,” you get a chance to figure out the answer to that question. You have two jobs, (1) attempting to learn more about the students as a Guesser and (2) jumping into the shoes of the Students and acting out their reactions. 

As a Guesser, you present different situations for the Student player to react to. Watch their reactions carefully and try to correctly identify what kind of motivation this particular student is trying to embody before anyone else to earn points. But be careful, get it wrong, and your points get deducted.

As a Student, you have the freedom of choosing which one of the motivation topics from those detailed on the game tiles and the responsibility of acting out this motivation properly. Gain points by portraying this motivation as best as you can.

Long Description

When tackling the idea of motivation, the designer and her partner decided to split the topic into two different games, one to identify the problem/motivation and one to explore actions to take once the problem/motivation has been identified. This purpose of this game is to show the range of prospective student motivations and to practice identifying these motivations based on student behaviors. A player does so by making observations about their student as a Guesser and jumping into the shoes of their students when they take on the Student role.

The game play is reminiscent of the game “Guess Who.” However, this is a version that uses motivation topics rather than faces and it gets increasingly difficult as you go along. Beginning with 3 motivation topics, the player chosen to act in the Student role will get to choose which one of these topics they will act out. The other players are Guessers. These players tell the Student different situations that can happen in the classroom and the Student will act out what they would do in this situation according to the motivation they chose. The Guessers can give the Student a maximum of 5 situations, but they must figure out which of the 3 motivation topics the Student has chosen before the Student finishes their act in the last situation. Once the round has ended, a new motivation topic is added to the current. So now the player with the Student role now has 4 different motivation topics they can act out. Each round adds one new motivation topic until 2 rounds have been played with all motivation topics.

This game aims to help the players understand different student behaviors and develop their abilities to associate different behaviors with student motivations. If a player is able to act out their role as a Student properly, this means that they have an understanding of how a future student with the same motivation would act since they displayed the correct behaviors. Another players should be able to correctly identify the motivation and so this player is awarded 3 points. The player that got it correctly shows that they are able to identify motivations based on what they observed and is rewarded 5 points. However to deter players from guessing for the sake of guessing and to incentivize them to use their deduction skills instead, 3 points is deducted from the scores of players who guess wrong. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points by the end of the game showing that they understand a student’s motivation through observing and acting out certain behaviors.

Version Control

Different versions have version types in this form: v(1st#).(2nd#).(3rd#)

For example, the very first iteration of a file is v1.1.1

Changes in the first number (v1.1.1 -> v2.1.1) means that an essential part of the game play has changed and so the file was adjusted to compensate for that.

Changes in the second number (v2.1.1 -> v2.2.1) means that an large part of the file itself has changed, but the it isn't because of the game play.

Changes in the third number (v2.2.1 -> v2.2.2) means that some part of the file has changed, but it isn't a significant difference, but that there are some changes.

Bio:
Jacynth is an uprising sophomore in Course 2A-3 (Mechanical Engineering with a focus on Material Science). She has been working with the Teaching Systems Lab over the summer to create a Learning Science Playground. She initially became interested in teaching because her favorite class in high school, Calculus, was discussion-based rather than lecture-based. She personally thrived in this environment, but could see the struggles of other students who were not used to such a style of learning. At the same time, Jacynth is also a board game enthusiast who happened to gain some VR game development and toy creation experience during her first year at MIT. Wanting to know more about the science of learning and hoping to apply some skills that she had gained in the past year, Jacynth found that working on this project was a significant and rewarding experience.

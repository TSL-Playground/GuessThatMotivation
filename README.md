Version Control

Different versions have version types in this form: v(1st#).(2nd#).(3rd#)
For example, the very first iteration of a file is v1.1.1

Changes in the first number (v1.1.1 -> v2.1.1) means that an essential part of the game play has changed and so the file was adjusted to compensate for that.

Changes in the second number (v2.1.1 -> v2.2.1) means that an large part of the file itself has changed, but the it isn't because of the game play.

Changes in the third number (v2.2.1 -> v2.2.2) means that some part of the file has changed, but it isn't a significant difference, but that there are some changes.
